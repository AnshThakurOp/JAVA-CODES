<<<<----------------------------SELECTION SORTING---------------------->>>>
Selection sorting is the sorting technique used for sorting arrys or list having less number of elements.

In Selection sorting we just replace the elements on their index value:-
Considering the case of ascending sorting --> Firstly we have to put the max element in the arry to last index.
Then we have put to second max element on the last second index and so on..

1 -> First we have to assign a variable which will store the "max_index" always - Jaise hi ek element last index pe pahuch jayega to hame "max_index" ki value ko change karke last second index assign karana padega.
Thats why we have to use a loop which will change the value of the max_index after putting the max elements too their respective index position.

for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
int max_index = arr.length - 1 - i --> - i to change the max_index value after every iteration or we can say after putting max element at its postition.
}
.
2 -> Secondly we have to the index value of the maximum element in the unsorted array, which we have to replace.
Jaise ham max element find karte waise hi karenge bas uska index nikal(return) kar lenge.
Assign it with the variable name max_ele_index.

3 -> In the last step we only have to swap the max_ele_index with the max_index.
